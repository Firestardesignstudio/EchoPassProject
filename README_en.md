# Echo Pass Project  
AI–Human Coexistence Infrastructure for Safe Mobility  

> Technology is not for control, but for coexistence.  
> 技術は支配のためではなく、共に生きるためにある。

### 🌏 Overview  
The **Echo Pass Project** is an open-source concept that reimagines  
visual support, walking assistance, and urban accessibility  
through collaboration between **AI and humans**.

AI acts as a “translator” between humans and machines,  
integrating data from multiple assistive devices such as  
smart canes, smart glasses, GPS, beacons, and NFC tags,  
then conveying this information as **human-understandable speech**.

### 🎯 Mission  
To build cities where everyone can walk safely—  
by translating machine signals into human understanding through AI.

---

### 🧩 Core Components  
- **Smart Stick** — Equipped with LiDAR, Ultrasonic, and IMU sensors  
- **Smart Glass** — Integrated camera and object detection  
- **Beacons & NFC Tags** — Provide environmental and navigation data  
- **AI Core** — GPT-based processing for translation and summarization
